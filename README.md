# This is the code for LGCN
1. If you want to run our code, you need to unzip all zip files.
2. Since the file size is limited, we delete Movielens dataset and the embeddings trained on it. Only Amazon dataset is reserved. In the Amazon directory, we delete hypergraph embeddings for comparison experiment and reserved our proposed model. If you want to validate the result, you can train hypergraph embeddings from the start.
